# CS-226 Project

### Changes to be made in report

###### Page 8
* Used binary encoding
* Total 22 states. s\alpha , s0-s19,S2'

###### Page 3
* state s2 has c.wr and z.wr as well
* state s2' has z.wr
* state s4 has c.wr and z.wr as well
* state s10 has z.wr as well

##### Page 6(State tranisitions)

* ADC,ADZ,NDC,NDZ you have to jump from s1 to S\alpha state appropriately and not to s0
